# baby_names

In this codelab, you&#x27;ll learn how to create a Flutter app that uses Firebase. The app helps new parents choose baby names by letting friends and family vote for their favorites. Specifically, the app accesses a Cloud Firestore database, and a user action in your app (i.e., tapping a name option) updates the database atomically.
